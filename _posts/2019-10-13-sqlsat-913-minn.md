It’s been a couple of years since I have been able to attend a SQL Saturday. I was grateful I was able to make it this year. This year however was a first for me, it was my first SQL Saturday in Minnesota and the first time I went to a precon, both were enjoyable.

On Friday, I went to Monica Rathbun’s ([blog](https://sqlespresso.com/)/[twitter](https://twitter.com/SQLEspresso?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)) precon – [SQL Server Performance Tuning and Optimization for the DBA](https://sqlsathistory.com/SQLSat0913.html). It was definitely worth the time and expense. I learned a lot and Monica is an excellent, as well as an energetic, speaker. I was reminded, when it comes to SQL not everything is set in stone. Saturday was equally as good…although the weather turned and spent the day watching snow squalls.

It made the 3-hour drive home a bit longer. I concentrated on DevOps tracks, with the exception of a presentation on leadership given by James Phillips (b/t). I really enjoyed James’ presentation and wish more managers were as focused on being leaders as he was. All in all, it was a great couple of days of learning.

My only regret was I wish I had stayed overnight one more night to attend the after-party. Ah well, maybe next year..

I came across an article on [SQL Server Central](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/) written by Claudio Silva ([blog](https://claudioessilva.eu/)/[twitter](https://twitter.com/claudioessilva)) discussing that you can't do arithmetic operations on DateTime2 like you can with DateTime.

For example:

Old Way
```sql
OrderDate < GETDATE() -1
```

You need to do something like this:

```sql
OrderDate < DATEADD(dd, -1, @vOrderDate)
```

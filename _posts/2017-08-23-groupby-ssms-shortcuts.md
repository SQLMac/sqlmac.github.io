Every so often, you come across game-changing information and most of the time, this type of information costs money. So it is EXTREMELY rare to come across this type of information for free. With that being said, I wanted to give a shout-out, and HUGE Thank You, to Brent Ozar for putting all the energy into the Group By sessions and what an awesome way to give back to the SQL community. They are just awesome.

With all the training options out there, I often run behind trying to keep up. Thankfully the Group By videos are posted on YouTube. This one session though has just blown my mind with useful shortcuts in SSMS. I'll definitely be rewatching this video a few times.

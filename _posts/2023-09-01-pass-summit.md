# Pass Data Summit 2023

### I am excited that I finally get to go to Pass. 

It's funny how it happened. I have been working on trying to make our database operations more devops friendly along with learning Postgres. It just so happens I caught an email about Pass with tracks on those two very things. 

I don't know whether or not my wonderful wife took pity on me or what, but she was all for me going even though it's an out of pocket expense for us. 

I am looking forward to this. Being an introvert, conferences take a lot out of me. I'm also not the most social person, but I'll figure it out. Maybe I'll walk around and collect autographs to help break the ice. Maybe I can think of something for people to sign.

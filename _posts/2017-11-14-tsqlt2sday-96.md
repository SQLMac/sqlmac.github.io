I think I’m actually going to make this TSQL Tuesday, it’s the first for me in a while. I kind of have a valid excuse, I left my job at the hospital in Denver and took a job in Duluth, MN. So currently I’m in the middle of a cross country move, and if you’re ever done one….you know the fun I’m having. Oh ya, and there’s the new job and the learning that goes with it which I’ll hopefully get a post about soon. In the meantime though, I am going to mention a few of the people who have made a difference to me personally. This month's TSQL Tuesday is hosted by Ewald Cress (blog/twitter). 

In the spirit of giving thanks, I’d like to a moment to take a moment to thank all of those in the community that I have helped my SQL learning by supplying great information. While I don’t personally know these folks, I am grateful every day I get to learn from them. By no means is it an exhaustive list... just the blogs and Twitter feeds that have been most prominent for me lately.

One of the things all of these people have in common is that they have inspired me to be a better DBA. In fact, some of them have inspired me to be a better developer (ok, just be a developer). The point is, for me personally, these are some of my professional mentors. I follow their blogs, webcasts, or in some cases both. They all freely give their time and energy to better the SQL community. Every one of them is an inspiration of what makes the SQL community so special. So to all of you, I say Thank you. Your contributions are truly appreciated and are invaluable for the rest of us.

I’d also like to take a moment to thank my former coworkers. I learned so much from Michael and Toni in such a short time. You two will always be on the list of best DBAs I have ever worked with.

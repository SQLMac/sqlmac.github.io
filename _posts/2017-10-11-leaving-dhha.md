### Leaving DHHA

It's hard to believe this is my last week in Denver. Come Monday I am moving to northern Wisconsin. I'm jumping in the truck alone to head for the Great Lake region with my wife following in December. Which, for me at the moment, maybe the hardest part of this move. But that's neither here nor there for this blog. What is important, is that I am leaving an organization that I have enjoyed working for even when I have disagreed with some of their decisions. I guess that's part of being employed though, you work for an organization but you don't always agree with their every decision. Similar to being married or being a parent I suppose, or maybe it's just closer to being human.

I'm going to miss my co-workers and the comfortable atmosphere they provided. It's been a lot of fun to work at this hospital and with the staff. There's a little bit of emotion in it. I'm going to miss my team, I thought we worked extremely well together. The jokes, conversations, and discussions have been thoroughly appreciated. I must admit, I am struggling to let go a bit. I've been involved in some of these projects for three years and I'm vested in the outcome.

This last week, I feel more like a consultant in the sense I am just answering questions and doing write ups. I've also been giving some thought to the new position and some of the things I can help with immediately. But that's based off my limited understanding of the architecture and environment, so hard to really walk in and contribute day one.

Next week, I head up to Wisconsin and start getting personal things in order. Maybe I'll have time to get some personal project work in too. Next week starts a new adventure.

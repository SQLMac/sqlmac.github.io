# Windows is fading

Ok, to be fair...

Windows is fading in my technological life, maybe not everyone else's. Earlier this spring I replaced my older desktop with a Mac Studio. Nothing fancy, it's an M1 I picked up from Costco. I had previously been using an Ubuntu desktop, but grew tired of the hacky way I had to sometimes make things work. So, back to a Mac it was. 

I tried to break out of the Apple ecosystem only to get pulled back in. C'est la vie !

Well shortly after that, my Dell work laptop started to have issues and I joking suggested they just give me a Mac and be done with it. Carbon Black couldn't be as bad on a Mac, and then there is the whole lack of GPO to slow it down. Shockingly, they agreed and my manager approved. So I am the first IT person in the group to have a Mac. Not bad for a SQL DBA. 

Although I suspect it has more to do with the push to migrate away from SQL Server to Postgres to get away from rising [licensing costs](https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/23/sql_server_2022_price_rises/). I can't say I blame them. Lately MS has been feeling more like Oracle, and I can't say I'm a fan of their propensity to integrate AI into everything. Maybe if they were better at security it wouldn't bother me as much. 

Then again, I may not be the only one. It seems Mac is [encroaching on the Enterprise](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/08/29/apple-hardware-is-a-benefit-to-enterprise-survey-reveals) as a whole. [ComputerWorld is reporting something similiar](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3705669/idc-sees-big-enterprise-shift-to-macs-over-next-12-months.html). This should be interesting to watch.

Some times I just want to kick myself. A very simple concept that I never thought about applying to work, I was bouncing around the internet trying to get a better understanding of how to use source control with my script library when I found a rabbit hole.

The rabbit hole in question was of the "How to write better code" / "How to be a better developer" variety when I came across an article about keeping a journal for programming. In fact, it was [this article](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/become-better-coder-keeping-programming-journal/).

Dammit. Why hadn't I thought of that sooner? I suppose it follows the advice about posting articles/resources on your blog for you to search against later. It just hadn't occurred to me to keep a journal discussing ideas that weren't ideal for blogs for various reasons.

For the last several years I have been quietly toying with, or thinking about, how difficult would it be to switch from the full-blown Windows Desktop and switch up to running SQL on Windows Core as the default. The major difference is the convenience for admins and DBA to access the server. But why? Why haven't we given up the crutch of the desktop? Remote Windows tools make most of the basic administration a breeze, even though it's a bit slow. Is it that we don't want to have to write PowerShell scripts?Â

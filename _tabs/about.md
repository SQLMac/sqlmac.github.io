### Just a guy in the woods

Well check it out, someone wants to know more about me...I'm not sure what to tell you. I live in Northern WI, I'm originally from Colorado, and spent some time in Oklahoma. Oh, and there was a three - four stint in Texas. 

When I'm not messing around in my day job as a SQL DBA, I'm probably messing with:

- Chores
- Fixing something - house, car, computer, or something else that broke that I didn't want to mess with
- Hiking
- Occasionally fish
- Camping
- Ride my Dirt Bike
- Or make someone's ears bleed (mostly mine) hacking around with a guitar

Here lately I have been working on learning more about DevOps and building out a home lab. I can also be found running as a volunteer EMT.
